# OOP-Task-1c_Skelington
Polymorphism bank task

## Introduction to task
You are required to demonstrate your understanding of some of the principles of the OO
approach and your competence in applying the C++ programming techniques presented in
Semester 2 to implement a design documented in UML.
The questions for this assignment refer to the Case Study #2 (ATM) used in some of your
lectures and tutorials on UML and C++.
This document (OOP_Task1c_BRIEF.docx) contains the list of additional requirements for the
system together with relevant UML documentation. You are also provided with a partial C++
implementation of the system that is available from Bb (project and source files in
OOP_Task1c_SKELETON.zip).

 ### Study the C++ program provided and the related UML documentation and:
- answer questions about them (Question 1)
- provide some additional UML documentation (Question 2)
- apply fundamental OO principles and techniques presented this semester to your C++
implementation and extend the C++ skeleton program so that it offers additional
functionality (Question 3)
- implement a hierarchy of classes allowing for true polymorphic behaviour (Question 4)
- use more advanced design and programming techniques including templates, abstract
classes, use of STL containers and singleton pattern (Question 5).
You need to produce a report with answers to the questions and extracts of your solutions and
to participate to a walkthrough (i.e. demonstration of your C++ program).
This is a group assignment that counts for 25% of the mark for the OOP module.
